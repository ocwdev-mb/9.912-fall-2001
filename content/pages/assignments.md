This assignment is for graduate level credit in the class.

Graduate Assignment
-------------------

15- to 20-page paper

For students interested in receiving credit towards their PhD major and/or minor, please contact TA to discuss the details of the additional requirements. In general, these requirements will consist of at least one paper proposing a novel fMRI study designed to address one of the debates considered during the term. The proposal should be relatively detailed, providing an initial theoretical and empirical review (going beyond the articles discussed in class), explication of the proposed experimental design, and delineation of predictions and implications. It is anticipated that such proposals would be approximately 15-20 pages. The proposal will constitute 50% of the final grade (the other 50% being class participation).
