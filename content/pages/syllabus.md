Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Overview
--------

Memory is not a unitary faculty, but rather consists of multiple forms of learning that differ in their operating characteristics and neurobiological substrates. This seminar will consider current debates regarding the cognitive and neural architectures of memory, specifically focusing on recent efforts to address these controversies through application of functional neuroimaging (primarily fMRI and PET).

Through readings of conceptual "seed" articles and group discussion of neuroimaging investigations, the aim is to provide a forum in which new empirical efforts to address these debates may emerge. There are no prerequisites for this course.

Course Requirements
-------------------

100% for class participation. Again, both the seed and imaging readings should be completed prior to class. Students should be prepared to contribute to and participate in the discussion of the neuroimaging articles. The success of the discussions will be a direct function of the degree to which all participants come prepared to consider each paper.

For students interested in receiving credit towards their PhD major and/or minor, please contactÂ TA to discuss the details of the additional requirements. In general, these requirements will consist of at least one paper proposing a novel fMRI study designed to address one of the debates considered during the term. The proposal should be relatively detailed, providing an initial theoretical and empirical review (going beyond the articles discussed in class), explication of the proposed experimental design, and delineation of predictions and implications. It is anticipated that such proposals would be approximately 15-20 pages. The proposal will constitute 50% of the final grade (the other 50% being class participation).
